          You might think that hydroponics is a relatively new method for growing plants– you’d be wrong!
        </p>
        <ul class="hydroponic-history">
          <li>
            <strong>Gardeners have been growing plants in hydroponic gardens for at least 2600 years</strong>, possibly beginning with the legendary Hanging Gardens of Babylon built around 600 BC in Babylonia or Mesopotamia and situated along the Euphrates River.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>In the 10th and 11th centuries</strong> the Aztec people created floating gardens in Lake Tenochtitlan in Mexico. To create these floating gardens plants they took soil from the bottom of the lake – soil which was rich in nutrients.
          </li>
          <li> 
            <strong>In the 1620s</strong> Sir Francis Bacon, a British scientist, philosopher and politician did research on soil-less gardening. His work, ‘Sylva Sylvarum’ published in 1627, started a wave of research into hydroponics.
          </li>
          <li> 
            <strong>In 1699</strong> the British scientist John Woodward mixed together water and soil to use as a root media – he was one of the first people to understand that plants absorb nutrients from soil and water.
          </li>
          <li> 
            <strong>Throughout the 1850’s</strong> French scientist Jean Baptiste Boussingault carried out experiments with inert growing media. He was able to conclude that water was essential for plant growth by providing hydrogen.
          </li>
          <li> 
            <strong>By the early 1900s</strong> scientists had analysed the minerals and other materials which are necessary for plant growth and had devised formulas for liquid nutrients that could be used instead of soil. Prior to 1925 most of the work was restricted to the laboratory.
          </li>
          <li> 
            <strong>In 1924</strong> Dr William F Gericke of the University of California created the word ‘hydroponics’ to describe crops growing in non-soil media and nutrient–enriched water indoors and outdoors. Gericke grew vegetables hydroponically – in fact he managed to grow tomatoes to heights of 7mt.
          </li>
          <li> 
            <strong>In 1938</strong> Berkeley scientists Dennis Hoagland and Daniel Arnon published ‘The Water Culture Method for Growing Plants without Soil’. This is widely considered to be one of the most important texts ever published about hydroponics.
          </li>
          <li> 
            <strong>During World War II (1939-1945)</strong> hydroponics  ‘gravel method’ was used in order to grow thousands of tonnes of food for soldiers in remote locations where conventional growing was impossible.
          </li>
          <li> 
            <strong>In 1952</strong> the U.S. Army had a special hydroponics branch which was able to produce over 3,629,000 kg of fresh produce.</li>
          <li> 
            <strong>Throughout the 1950’s</strong> the commercial use of hydroponics expanded throughout countries including England, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Spain and USSR.
          </li>
          <li> 
            <strong>By the 1960’s</strong> hydroponics had become a major industry worldwide, being popular in parts of America, Australia, France, Germany, Holland, Japan, the Middle East, Russia and South Africa.
          </li>
          <li> 
            <strong>In recent years</strong> NASA has carried out extensive research for their ‘Controlled Ecological Life Support System’ or ‘CELSS’. Hydroponics intended to take place on Mars are using LED lighting to grow in different colour spectrum with much less heat.
          </li>
          <li> <strong>Nowadays hydroponics is becoming increasingly important</strong> as global warming, desertification, oil and water shortages are becoming increasingly significant. Recent research has found that there are over 1,000,000 households in the U.S. use hydroponics to grow food alone.</li>
